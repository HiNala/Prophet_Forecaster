Below is an expanded, step-by-step plan that outlines a clear path for developing each module in a CLI-based forecasting tool with browser-based visualizations. The plan emphasizes modularity and scalability, ensuring each component can be developed, tested, and enhanced independently.

---

## **1. Data Input and Initial Analysis**

### **1.1 CLI Data Input**
1. **Prompt for File Path**  
   - Request a file path via a CLI command, e.g., `myapp data --file_path="data.csv"`.
2. **Validate User Arguments**  
   - Ensure the datetime column (`ds` or user-defined) and the target column (`y` or user-defined) are provided.

### **1.2 Initial Data Preparation**
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Use `pandas.read_csv()` (or similar) to read the dataset, validating that the specified columns exist.
   - Check for correct datetime formatting and parse dates as needed.
2. **Basic Sanity Checks**  
   - Confirm there are enough data points to perform meaningful forecasting.
   - Identify and warn about any potential data issues (e.g., large numeric ranges, suspicious data patterns).

### **1.3 Initial Visualization**
1. **Time Series Plot**  
   - Generate a simple line chart (using matplotlib, Plotly, or Bokeh) to visualize the raw target over time.
   - Optionally display summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) in the CLI output.

---

## **2. Data Cleaning and Intermediate Processing**

### **2.1 Data Cleaning**
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Offer methods such as dropping rows, forward fill, backward fill, or interpolation (e.g., `--method="impute"`).
   - Provide a CLI flag or parameter to choose the method (e.g., `--missing_value_method="drop"`).
2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**  
   - Allow users to choose from methods like IQR-based filtering or z-score thresholds (e.g., `--outlier_method="zscore"`).
   - Optionally remove or cap outliers based on user-defined thresholds.

### **2.2 Intermediate Data Visualization**
1. **Before-and-After Comparisons**  
   - Plot histograms or boxplots to show distribution changes pre- and post-cleaning.
2. **Trend & Seasonal Checks**  
   - Provide small multiples or line charts to examine data trends and seasonality after cleaning.

---

## **3. Technical Indicators and Enhanced Visualization**

### **3.1 Technical Indicators**
1. **User-Defined Indicator List**  
   - Accept a list of indicators (e.g., `SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD`) via CLI parameters.
2. **Feature Engineering for Indicators**  
   - For each indicator, calculate and append a new column to the dataframe (e.g., `SMA_10`, `RSI_14`).
   - Use libraries like TA-Lib or custom functions to compute these indicators.

### **3.2 Enhanced Data Visualization**
1. **Overlay Indicators**  
   - Overlay indicators (e.g., moving averages) on the time series plot for visual inspection.
   - For oscillators like RSI, generate a separate subplot for clarity.
2. **Interactive Charts**  
   - Leverage Plotly or Bokeh to provide hover info, zoom/pan, and toggle on/off indicators.
   - Optionally generate an HTML report showing these visualizations for later review.

---

## **4. Final Data Preparation**

### **4.1 Synthetic Feature Generation**
1. **Lagged Features**  
   - Add lagged versions of `y` (e.g., `y_lag1`, `y_lag7`) for capturing short-term dependencies.
2. **Rolling Statistics**  
   - Create rolling means or rolling standard deviations (e.g., `rolling_mean_7`) for smoothing.
3. **Calendar/Seasonal Features**  
   - Extract day-of-week, month, or holiday flags if relevant to the forecast.

### **4.2 Data Shaping for Prophet**
1. **Prophet Requirements**  
   - Ensure final dataframe has `ds` (datetime) and `y` (target) as columns for Prophet.
   - If additional regressors (e.g., technical indicators) are used, confirm each is a column in the final dataset.
2. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split your data into training and validation sets to enable model tuning (if desired).

---

## **5. Model Training and Forecasting**

### **5.1 Prophet Model Configuration**
1. **Parameter Specification**  
   - Expose Prophet parameters via CLI (e.g., `--seasonality_mode="additive"`).
   - Allow user to enable/disable daily/weekly/yearly seasonality or holiday effects.
2. **Adding Regressors**  
   - If user has chosen to include additional columns (technical indicators, synthetic features) as Prophet regressors, incorporate them during model fitting.

### **5.2 Model Training**
1. **Training Execution**  
   - Call the Prophet `fit()` method on the training portion of the dataset.
   - Show a CLI loading indicator or progress bar (e.g., a spinning cursor or tqdm-like bar).
2. **Training Logging**  
   - Print or log diagnostic information (e.g., training time, final parameters, number of iterations).

### **5.3 Forecast Generation**
1. **Future Dataframe Creation**  
   - Use Prophet’s built-in `make_future_dataframe()` to define the forecast horizon (e.g., `--periods=60` days).
2. **Forecast Computation**  
   - Use `model.predict(future_dataframe)` to generate predictions.
   - Integrate any additional regressors (like SMA, RSI) for the forecast period if relevant.
3. **Output Storage**  
   - Save the forecast results to a user-specified location or provide a default file name (e.g., `forecast.csv`).

## **6. Forecast Evaluation and Visualization**

### **6.1 Forecast Visualization**
1. **Plot Predictions vs. Actuals**  
   - Generate a line chart showing actual historical values and forecasted values (with confidence intervals).
2. **Interactive Components**  
   - Allow the user to hover and see exact forecast values and intervals.
   - Provide separate components for trend and seasonality plots.

### **6.2 Model Evaluation**
1. **Cross-Validation**  
   - Implement Prophet’s `cross_validation()` and `performance_metrics()` for rigorous evaluation.
   - Provide CLI parameters for the initial window size, forecast horizon, and cutoffs.
2. **Error Metrics**  
   - Display MAPE, MAE, RMSE, or other relevant metrics in both CLI and visual format.
3. **Diagnostic Plots**  
   - Plot Prophet’s diagnostic charts (e.g., residuals, trend decomposition) for deeper insights.
